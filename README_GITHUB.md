## 🎯 About

**ÉBAN** (Ethical Beneficiary-Assisted Network) is a 3-level ecosystem that transforms fragmented social care into ethical collective evidence — honoring individual stories while generating territorial intelligence for policy-making.

### Core Values

- 💙 **Dignity** — People, not "cases"
- 🤝 **Consent** — Granular and respected  
- 🛡️ **Privacy** — Pseudonyms + aggregation by design
- 🌍 **Collective Impact** — Together, not competitive
- ❌ **No Rankings** — We measure care, not competition

---

## 🌍 Philosophy

### African Wisdom Foundations

ÉBAN is built on two ancestral African proverbs:

#### 1. 🧺 → 🏺 "Carrying Water in a Basket"

> Without ethical structure for data, social impact **escapes** like water through a basket.

**ÉBAN offers the "jar"** — a system that preserves impact with dignity.

#### 2. 🦁 "Until the Lion Learns to Write"

> Until the lion learns to write, all stories glorify the hunter.

**ÉBAN teaches the lion to write** — transforming stories into evidence, evidence into voice that influences policy.

---

### Cultural Roots

**Logo**: Our logo incorporates an **Adinkra symbol** from the Akan people (Ghana/Ivory Coast) meaning **"care"**.

This choice reflects ÉBAN's commitment to:
- 🌍 Technology rooted in African values (Ubuntu, Djunta Mon)
- ✊🏾 Decolonial approach to social tech
- 👑 Dignity as foundation, not afterthought

> *"Technology without culture is colonization.  
> Technology with culture is liberation."*

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

ÉBAN consists of 3 integrated levels:

```
📱 LEVEL 1: Blueprint App (Field)
   └─ For: Field workers
      Purpose: Record each story with dignity
      Features: Offline-first, pseudonymization, granular consent

📊 LEVEL 2: Institutional Dashboard (Management)  
   └─ For: Coordinators
      Purpose: Aggregated organizational view
      Features: Humanized KPIs, compliance tracking, no individual cases

🌍 LEVEL 3: Social Observatory (Territory)
   └─ For: Policy makers
      Purpose: Multi-organizational collective intelligence
      Features: Anonymous aggregation, SDG alignment, no drill-down
```

---

## 💙 Language Transformation

One of ÉBAN's core innovations is **empathetic language**:

| ❌ Before (Technical) | ✅ After (Empathetic) |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Register Case | Welcome a New Person |
| Active Cases | People Supported |
| Beneficiaries | Individuals, People |
| Case History | Stories of Care |
| Data Quality Issues | Opportunities to Improve |

**Every word respects human dignity.**

### 🚀 [**Try the Live Prototypes**](https://eban-prog.github.io/eban-blueprint-demo/)

Explore the 3 levels of ÉBAN:

### 1. 📱 [Blueprint App](https://eban-prog.github.io/eban-blueprint-demo/index.html)
**Field worker interface**
- "Welcome a New Person", not "Register Case"
- Automatic pseudonymization (João Silva → BEN-JO-A1B2)
- Privacy Shield for screen sharing
- Offline-first design

### 2. 📊 [Institutional Dashboard](https://eban-prog.github.io/eban-blueprint-demo/dashboard-institutional.html)
**Coordinator view**
- "People Supported: 214"
- Humanized KPIs and compliance tracking
- Opportunities for improvement (not "problems")
- No identifiable individual cases

### 3. 🌍 [Social Observatory](https://eban-prog.github.io/eban-blueprint-demo/observatory-social.html)
**Territorial intelligence**
- Multi-organizational insights (18+ orgs)
- SDG alignment tracking
- Fully anonymous aggregation
- Policy-ready evidence

> **Note**: These are functional prototypes demonstrating core concepts and interface design.

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Ethics by Design

### Automatic Pseudonymization
```
João Silva → BEN-JO-A1B2-C3D4
```
Names are replaced with pronounceable codes immediately.

### Granular Consent
- **Local**: Data stays within organization
- **Federated**: Shared with ÉBAN network
- **Fully Anonymous**: Only aggregates to observatory

### No Individual Drill-Down
Observatory shows only collective patterns. No path to individual stories.

### Privacy Shield
One-click hide of sensitive data during screen sharing or meetings.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

### Example: Mental Health Coverage Gap

A Social Observatory revealed:
- **34%** of all cases were mental health related
- **2 sub-regions** had **0% coverage**
- **287 people** without access

**Result**: Coordinators presented ethical aggregated data to municipal council. Resources were allocated to the 2 under-served regions.

**🦁 Communities influenced public policy through ethical evidence.**
